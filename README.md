# Vending-Machine-FSM-
This project simulates a Vending Machine FSM using Verilog HDL. The vending machine accepts coins of 5 and 10 units. Once the total sum reaches or exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 15 units), the machine dispenses an item. The FSM transitions between states based on the inserted coin value and tracks the total amount.
